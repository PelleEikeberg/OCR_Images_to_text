# This is the folder in which to place Tesseract OCR installation  

Although this could have been a git submodule, there is some effort with installing tesseract from github source directly. I therefore point you to read how to install it through:

(main github page)
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract

or:
(compiling for each OS)
https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Compiling.html

if you install tesseract on windows through the installer:
https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
you may place the files inside this folder instead of the `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`


# Regardless of how you install tesseract, if you can run tesseract through your terminal directly, then this script will work.
